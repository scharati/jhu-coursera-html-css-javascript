Object creation :

Objects are created using the "new Object()" call.
properties can be set on the object using the "dot notation".
	var myObject = new Object();

	myObject.myProp = "propVal";

"myProp" is created if it does not exist already.

Objects can also be assigned to properties.

var mySubObject = new Object();
myObject.mysubObject =  mySubObject;

syntax:

var <object_name> = new Object();
<object_name>.<propName> = propVal;
propVal can be boolean,string etc

Another way of setting properties on the object :

<object_name>[<"propName">] = propVal
quotes are a must here.
