Arrays:

Arrays are collection of types. In programming languages arrays are generally collection of same types.
However in Javascript they are a collection of heterogenous types. 
Values in Arrays are accessed by [] notation (assignment and access)

var myCollection = new Array();

myCollection[0] = "Bharath";
myCollection[1] = {
	name: "Karnataka",
	capital: "Bengaluru"
};
myCollection[2] = function (){
	console.log("Namaste !!!");
};

Array Literal notation:

var literalArray = ["goa","karnataka",{name: "crime and punishment",author: "Dostevsky"}];
