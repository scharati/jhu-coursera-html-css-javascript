The policy document will now be sent to the Cabinet for review.

IB Raises Concerns Over 100 Per Cent FDI In Aviation: The government’s proposal to allow 100 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) in local airlines hit a roadblock after the Intelligence Bureau (IB) raised serious concerns citing security issues.

According to a source, the IB is of the view that foreign players should not be allowed to have 100 per cent stake in domestic airlines as aviation is a “highly sensitive sector”. The IB is also reported to have said that even developed countries like the US and Canada have permitted foreign entities to have only up to 25 per cent stake in their respective domestic carriers.
