Types are data structures used to store values in a language

Primitive types are types that can have single values and are immutable
Javascript has 7 types (6 primitive and one Object Type)

Object Type is bunch of name value pairs. Values can be promitive values or object types

Primitive Types are
boolean : can have true or false
undefined: implies a variable is defined but not had any value assigned
null - implies a special value null
number - represents 64 bit floating point (double precision): integers are a subset of this
string - represents sequence of characters/letters
