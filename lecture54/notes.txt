Event Handling:
Javascript events are an indication of different states of the browser. Event handlers are mechanisms to handle the events.
These are nothing but functions which are run on the occurrence of a particular event for which the subscription is there.

Event subscription can be done in 
1. HTML
2. Javascript

HTML:

It can done by specifying the event and the handler/function in the element as attribute.

<button onclick="buttonPressed();"> </button>

=> on "click" event on the button the "buttonPressed" function should be called.

The HTML way of subscribing to events is not recommended as HTML is for content and not for behaviour.

Javascript:
One can subscribe to specific events via javascript.
<element_to_observe_event_on>.addEventListener(<event_to_observe>, event_handler);

event: "DOMContentLoaded" indicates that the HTML document content is loaded but CSS and images are not yet loaded
