Closures:

Closures is a javascript language feature where an inner function has access to the outer lexical environment even when the outer lexical environment is not in execution.

function makeMultiplier(multiplier){
	
	return (function(x){
		 return x* multiplier;
	});
}


var doubleAll = makeMultiplier(2); //function body with multiplier = 2 is returned
console.log(doubleAll(10));// here makeMultiplier is out of execution but because of closures multiplier value i.e. 2 is still accessible
