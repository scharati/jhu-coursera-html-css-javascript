HTML5 document structure:

version specification : <!doctype html> indicates that the document is a standard HTML5 document
<!doctype --> one word
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
	</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>

meta tag is to communicate some meta information to the browser for rendering
meta tag has no closing tag
For instace from above it's telling the browser that all characters on the page are utf-8.

Browsers process HTML in sequential mode. One tag processed and then the next one.
