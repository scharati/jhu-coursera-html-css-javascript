Conflict resolution in css

Origin: 
The place of definition of css,when rules are sourced from multiple locations the last declaration wins.
This is when the rule target the same element and the properties being targeted are same


Merge:
When multiple rules are targeting same element but the properties being targeted are different the rules 
are merged

Inheritance:
HTML documents have tree structure with parent child relations. The rules which are specified for the parent
are inherited by the children.

Examples:

Origin case :

p{
	color : green;
}

p{
	color : red;
}

The second one wins.[based on origin of specification].

Merge case:

p{
	color: green
}

p{
	font-size: 130%
}

Both are merged since the target is same but properties are different.

Inheritance case:

body{
	color : red;
}

All elements inside body inherit the color red
