Fake Namespaces:

Namespaces is a concept/language feature which helps avoid clashes between programming variables. For instance we may have imported a library which has an exposed variable called "name". Then we import one  more library which again exposes the "name" variable. These are conflicting. Namespaces provide a way of uniquely identifying variables.

Java script does not have the concept of namespaces but it can be emulated by other means.

The way to do this is via objects.
Expose functions on unique objectNames that way there would be no conflicts.
