Anatomy of a CSS Rule:

CSS is specified as Rules to be applied to content.
Here's the structure of a Rule:
<selector>{
	<property>:<value>;
}

selector: specifies to which element[s] the rule is applicable

property: specifies the property this particular rule modifies 
[property is specified in the CSS specification]

value: specifies the value to be applied for the particular property

;: semicolon to terminate the property:value pair

p{
	color:blue;
}

p: selector: implies this rule is applicable to all "p" elements i.e. paragraphs
color: the property which is the color of the content in "p" element in this case
blue: the color to be applied to the content of paragraph
