Positioning : It is about locating elements on the page
There are following positioning schemes available:
{
	position: static|relative|absolute
	top : xx px => from top
	left : xx px => from left
	right:xx px => from right
	bottom: xx px => from bottom
}

1.static: default for all except "html" element. It's just another name for
normal document flow. Offsets are "ignored" in this positioning scheme

2.relative: In this scheme offsets are applied relative to the "normal document flow" 
position of the element.
The element remains in the normal document flow position

3. absolute: In this scheme offsets are applied relative to the position of the first ancestor
with positioning - absolute or relative
html default positioning scheme is relative
Element is removed from normal document flow position in this scheme

useful for laying out elements in a container and maintaining the relative poistions of 
elements inside the container element
