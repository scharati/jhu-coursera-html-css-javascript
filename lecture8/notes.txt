HTML Entities:
	A way of specifying tags so that special characters are rendered correctly.
	In HTML < > and & have special meanings. < and > are used for opening and closing tags
	If we want to literally render < then < cannot be used but &lt; should be used
	similarly > = &gt;
	& = &amp;

&nbsp; = non breaking space = used to ensure a piece of text moves together
Jammu and Kashmir - > if we want it to move together i.e never have Jammu or Kashmir on 
separate lines = Jammu&nbsp;and&nbsp;Kashmir
This will make "Jammu and Kashmir" move together
