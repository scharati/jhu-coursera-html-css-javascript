Floating elements: This means rendering HTML elements differently from the normal flow.
In the normal flow:
HTML elements are rendered sequentially.
Floating will take the elements out of the normal flow and render.
<selector>
{
	float:left|right|initial|inherit
}

"clear" is the property to be used to avoid elements being rendered around the floated element.
By using "clear" the element will be rendered in the normal document flow.

Vertical Margins for floated elements:
Vertical margins are NOT collapsed for floated elements but they are preserved
